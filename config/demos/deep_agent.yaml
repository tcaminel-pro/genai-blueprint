      - Use Pydantic to define classes whenever possible
      - Avoid __init__ methods, use model_post_init() instead
      - Use Google style docstrings without mentioning types or exceptions
      - Use ``` to format code in documentation (Fenced Code Blocks)
      - Don't add comments for class fields and arguments
      
      Always write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code following best practices.
