"""Runnable Playground - Interactive testing environment for LangChain Runnables.

This module provides a Streamlit-based interface for testing and exploring LangChain Runnable components.
It allows users to:
- Select from available Runnables
- View diagrams and graphs of the Runnable structure
- Upload or select input files
- Execute Runnables with different configurations
- View execution results and traces

The playground integrates with LangSmith for tracing and monitoring when configured.
