- Use type annotation whenever possible
- Use 'None" type annotation when functions return nothing
- Use Python 12 capabilities - Typically use '|' instead of 'Union', and '| None' instead of 'Optional'
- Keep Python module presentation short.  Include main classes and functions description (one line). 
- Don't repeat code examples in module description if they are already in function docstrings. 
- Don't add comments for classes fields and arguments. Write only one line to describe the class.
- Keep trace instructions, such as 'debug(...)' or 'print(...)
- Use Pydantic for classes definition. Avoid __init__ methods, use model_post_init() instead.
- Rules for doctrings:
    - Use Google style 
    - Don't mention types 
    - Don't mention raised exceptions 
    - Use  ``` to format code in documentation (Fenced Code Blocks)
- use loguru for logging.  
- use rich for output pretty-printing
- use 'uv' to manage packages and execute tests, code etc. Ex: uv run pytest -v' to run pytest
